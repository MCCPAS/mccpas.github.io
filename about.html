            <h2>A short history of the Physics Alumni Society</h2>
            <p>The unfolding of events that led to the beginning of the alumni association of kindred 
            spirits is set forth here. Before the 'sands of time' obscure the actual elements and events,
            the most important details are recorded</p>

            <p>Dr. R. Balakrishnan (RBK) always used to feel that our past pupils were a great strength to further
                develop and strengthen the department. Dr. Samuel Asirvatham (SA) and Dr. N. Lakshminarayan (NLN) had
                often discussed organizing a meeting of Physics Deparment alumni. One day, there came along four
                spirited youngsters - Mr. Parthiban, Mr. Purushothaman, Mr. Radhakrishnan, and Mr. Vijay Reddy of the 
                1975-80 batch. They had come up with the idea of organizing an alumni meet. However, this idea did not 
                take off immediately. The idea then started spreading like wildfire in the modern jungle called the Internet.
                We now had a tiger by its tail and couldn't let go. It had to happen, and it did, in 2010!
